Maltair was then a 1RU IBM System x3550 M4 server with dual 8-core Xeon E5-2680 CPUs and 192GB DDR3 ECC RAM (1600 MHz). Originally labelled maltair, this became maltair (dead) and later old maltair (dead). Following RCD testing one day in August 2018, it very suddenly became completely dead. As it turns out, an IMM2 firmware bug affecting that particular model of server caused a current surge through the built-in voltage regulators every time it was powered on, which could vastly decrease the lifetime of the components and eventually would result in a system board failure requiring a replacement of the entire motherboard. ([BOB] attempted to locate and replace the failed component itself, however in the end it was unsuccessful).\",\n",
