       " 'In December 2019, Communities released All Path’s Lead to a Home: Western Australia’s 10-Year Strategy on Homelessness (the Strategy). The Strategy is a whole of community plan that reflects the complex nature of homelessness and features a bold vision that “everyone has a place to call home and is supported to achieve stable and independent lives”. Critical to delivering this vision is one of the Strategy’s priorities: Embed a Housing First approach in thehomelessness response system. \\nA Housing First approach, under the Strategy, prescribes safe and permanent housing as the first priority for people experiencing homelessness. Once housing is secured, a multidisciplinary team of support workers can address complex needs through services like drug and alcohol counselling or mental health treatment. The HFHI will be modelled around the internationally successful Housing First model. \\nThe HFHI will be delivered through a number of services, including:\\nThe Housing First System Coordinator (HFSC);\\nThe Housing First Support Service (HFSS) – Metropolitan and Regional;\\nThe Aboriginal Housing First Support Service (AHFSS) – Metropolitan and Regional; and \\nThe Finding Home Program.\\nThe Housing First System Coordinator\\nThe Housing First System Coordinator (HFSC) is responsible for the overall coordination of the HFHI across the Identified Locations (Perth, Rockingham/Mandurah, Bunbury and Geraldton). The HSFC will develop information sharing protocols to ensure information is shared in a timely manner and includes the development of complimentary protocols to aid in service delivery.  \\nKey outcomes for the HFSC will be to ensure that support services under the HFHI are well coordinated to ensure that the outcomes under the HFHI are achieved through a culturally safe and appropriate approach. Local place-based coordinators will work closely with the support workers, including after hours support to ensure people engaged in the HFHI do not fall through the gaps.\\nThe HFSC will continue to manage and maintain the existing ‘By Name List’ and will provide real time access to agencies under the HFHI to ensure that individuals and families do not fall through the gaps.\\nThe HFSC will provide initial training and support to the Housing First Support Services in the Identified Locations on key tools and the Vulnerability Index – Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool (VI-SPDAT).\\nThe Housing First Support Service\\nThe Housing First Support Service (HFSS) seeks to ensure people who are sleeping rough are linked into appropriate services that will help them find and maintain suitable accommodation. The HFSS will work closely with the HFSC and the Finding Home Program to ensure that appropriate housing is sought, and the right support services are in place to help people maintain their accommodation and do not cycle back into homelessness.\\nThe HFSS will have three functions: Identify, Engage and Support:\\nIdentify people sleeping rough in their nominated area;\\nEngage people into appropriate services, refer them into housing through the Finding Home Program or other suitable accommodation and/or services; and\\nSupport people to maintain their tenancy and prevent them from cycling back into homelessness.\\nPeople engaged under the HFHI will be provided with intensive case management support to help them maintain their tenancy through the HFSS, along with after-hours support.

The Strategy ensures that services remain contemporary and are agile enough to change to meet the needs of services users. \\nThe overarching Strategy requires Communities to produce an agency commissioning plan for contracted services with a focus on contracts that are expiring in 2021 and 2022. As such, Communities is working to shape a more coherent and holistic approach to delivering sustainable human and community services outcomes. \\nThe Contracting Directorate has the primary responsibility for the development and execution of Communities’ contract management and procurement activities. The key functions performed by the Contracting Directorate also form part of the broader Communities commissioning strategy.\\nWith growing demand for services, heightened expectations of government’s service responsibility, Communities’ needs more mature contract management practices to progress the commissioning of significant human services reforms and to ensure that it can deliver on its purpose. This will require embedding of better human services contract management practices across Communities to achieve the intended outcomes of the commissioning strategy. As such, Communities requires a suitable Contractor with relevant experience and understanding of commissioning frameworks and contract management best practice across government, to assist Communities in embedding its commissioning approach specifically in relation to contract management.\\nFunctional Review\\nIn 2020, Communities was tasked by the Expenditure Review Committee to undertake a Functional review covering Corporate, Policy and Contracting Functions. The intention of the Functional Review was to focus on current and forecast fiscal environments, including a review of Communities to ensure it meets its statutory requirements and needs of stakeholders, including clients. In addition, it aimed to identify barriers and enablers preventing Communities’ functions from achieving the current intended outcomes.  \\nIn 2021, Communities engaged an external consultant to undertake the Functional Review.

Core services provided will include actuarial investigations on the funded liabilities of GESB funds, liability reporting for self-funded agencies, forecasting of Gold State Super contributions, preparation of the actuarial certificates for the defined benefit sign-off for changes to the State Superannuation Regulations, investigation as to the state and sufficiency of the Gold State Super scheme and Pension Scheme Fund, preparation of benefit certificates for the defined benefit schemes and other actuarial advice required under the (State Superannuation Regulations 2001).\\nSee Schedule 2, Specification / Statement of Requirements for further information.\\nSubmission of Offer\\nBackground\\nGovernment Employees Superannuation Board (“GESB”) is a body corporate established under the State Superannuation Act 2000 (WA) (“SSA”) and is wholly owned and controlled by the State of Western Australia. GESB manages and administers the superannuation and retirement savings for over 240,000 current and former employees of the Western Australian public sector. As at 30 June 2020, GESB managed over A$29 billion in assets.\\nGESB schemes are administered in accordance with the SSA and State Superannuation Regulations 2001 (WA) (“the State laws”) (“SSR”). GESB is not licensed by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (“APRA”), however, the State of Western Australia is a signatory to the Heads of Government Agreement (“HoGA”) with the Commonwealth. The circumstances surrounding the schemes that GESB administers, include the complex nature of the defined benefit schemes, the public accountability of the schemes, State legislation governing the schemes and State prudential controls. \\nUnder HoGA Western Australia (and other state signatories to HoGA) has committed to ensure that member’s accrued benefits are securely protected, and the rules of its schemes will, as far as practicable, conform to the principles of the Commonwealth’s Retirement Income Policy. In return for this undertaking, the Commonwealth agreed to exempt the schemes that GESB administers from the relevant Commonwealth governing legislation for superannuation funds (i.e. the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (Cth) (“SIS Act”)). The SIS Act provides that exempt public sector superannuation schemes (“EPSSS”), such as the schemes that GESB administers, are deemed to be complying superannuation funds for superannuation guarantee purposes under the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth) and for income tax purposes under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) and Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth). \\nThe seven superannuation schemes currently administered by GESB are detailed below. Please refer to Table 1 – Scheme Attributes for a further breakdown:\\n\\nPension Scheme (including Provident Account)\\n(Including the Pension Scheme Contributors (PCS) and Pension Scheme Pensioners (PPS) as per Table 1 – Scheme Attributes)\\nThe Pension Scheme is an untaxed, unit-based, defined pension benefit scheme. The Pension Scheme was closed to new members on 15 August 1986.\\nMember contributions and benefits are directly related to the number of units for which a member contributes. The cost per unit depends upon four factors: gender, age, elected retirement age, and the number of units held. The level of pension benefit payable on retirement on or after attainment of age 55 years is directly related to the Member’s unit holding, final salary, and recognised length of Government Service. \\nThe basic benefits payable from the fund (not including the State’s Share or Employer unfunded portion) are:\\nA pension of $1 per fortnight for each unit held; or\\nA pension of $0.667 per fortnight to a widow or widower for each unit held by a contributor.\\nThe provisions of this scheme are contained within the Superannuation and Family Benefits Act 1938 (WA).\\n\\nGold State Super\\nGold State Super (“GSS”) is an untaxed, defined benefit, lump sum scheme with approximately $2.6 billion Funds under Management (FUM), as at 30 June 2020. GSS was closed to new members on 29 December 1995.\\nMember entitlements are dependent on the period of scheme membership, the Member’s average contribution rate, and the final average salary. \\nThe provisions of this scheme are contained within Part 2 of the SSR.\\n\\nWest State Super\\nWest State Super (“WSS”) is an untaxed, market-linked, defined employer contribution scheme with approximately $16.2 billionn FUM, as at 30 June 2020. WSS was closed to new members on 15 April 2007 except for a special class of members within GSS.\\nWSS was established to comply with the provisions of the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 (Cth) (“SGAA”). For the purpose of the SGAA, the scheme is an accumulation scheme however technically it may be a defined benefit fund under paragraph (a) of the definition of “defined benefit fund” in regulation 1.03 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations 1994 (Cth), due to a minimum benefit guarantee from the government of Western Australia of CPI plus 2%.\\nThe scheme is taxed differently from other retail or industry superannuation funds. No tax is deducted from contribution earnings, but a tax rate is applied at exit. Benefits include member investment choice from a range of investment options that include four readymade plans and five My Plan asset classes. A member may apply to change their choice of investment strategy. \\nThe employer contribution rate payable is determined under the SGAA and is currently 9.5%.\\nThe provisions of this scheme are contained within Part three (3) of the SSR.\\n\\nGESB Super \\nGESB Super (“GSU”) is a taxed, market linked, defined employer contribution scheme with approximately $4.9 billion FUM, as at 30 June 2020. GSU has been the default super scheme for all new WA State Public Sector employees from 16\\xa0April 2007.\\nGSU was established to comply with the provisions of the SGAA. For the purpose of the SGAA, the scheme is an accumulation scheme.\\nThe employer contribution rate payable is determined under the SGAA and is currently 9.5%.\\nThe provisions of this scheme are contained within Part 3A of the SSR.\\n\\nRetirement Income – Allocated Pension\\nRetirement Income Allocated Pension (“RI-AP”) is a taxed, market-linked allocated pension with approximately $5.3 billion FUM, as at 30 June 2020. RI-AP has been open to members from 19 March 2003. \\nRI-AP enables retiring members to keep their funds with GESB in a concessionally taxed environment, while receiving flexible periodic payments. It is available to members, former members and their partners who are looking for a regular income stream in retirement. The pension can be taken as either an Allocated Pension or a Transition to Retirement Pension.\\nMembers choose the level of pension payments they require between the minimum and maximum amounts set by Commonwealth Government laws. Payments can be made monthly, quarterly or annually and the frequency can be changed at any time. Additional lump sum payments of $1,000 or more can be withdrawn at any time. \\nWith RI-AP, members can close the account at any time simply by withdrawing all the funds. On death, the balance of the account is paid to the member’s estate or alternatively, the member may nominate, on the establishment of the account, a dependant to receive a reversionary pension.\\nThe provisions of this scheme are contained within Part four (4) of the SSR.\\n\\nRetirement Income – Term Allocated Pension\\nRetirement Income Term Allocated Pension (“RI-TAP”) is a taxed, market-linked term allocated pension with approximately $16.0 million FUM, as at 30 June 2020. RI-TAP was closed to new members on 20 September 2007.\\nRI-TAP provides members with an income stream similar to an allocated pension but with restricted redemption options and qualifies as a complying pension for tax and social security purposes. Earnings are credited to a member’s account based on the investment plan they have chosen from a range of four readymade plans or five My Plan asset classes. Members can change their choice or investment strategy. It was available to Members, former Members and their partners, who were looking for a regular income stream in retirement. \\nUnlike an Allocated Pension, a Term Allocated Pension provides an income over a fixed term based on the Member’s life expectancy and lump sum withdrawals are not permitted. Members choose the term of pension they require from a range linked to their life expectancy or that of their spouse. Payments can be made monthly, quarterly or annually and the frequency can be changed at any time. \\nGenerally, an RI-TAP account may not be closed after the first six months. On death, the balance of the account is paid to the member’s estate or alternatively, the member may nominate, on the establishment of the account, a dependant to receive a reversionary pension.\\nThe provisions of this scheme are contained within Part 4A of the SSR.\\nWith the Treasurer’s approval, the GESB Board appointed Link as its commercial provider of administration services, effective 1 July 2014. These administration services include, but are not limited to, contact centre operation, fund operations, fund accounting and tax, and finance operations. \\n\\n\\nTable 1 - Scheme Attributes\\n**Note: Information based on December 2020 unaudited da',\n",

GESB have over 80 years' experience managing members’ super savings and are the largest superfund in WA and one of the largest in Australia.\\nCurrently GESB have around 240,000 members and over $34 billion in funds under management (as at 30 June 2021). Under the WA state super regulations, GESB can only accept employer contributions from WA public sector employers.\\nGESB put its members first and advocates for them when it comes to their super and insurance. GESB’s members trust the organisation to look after their super and support them in making informed decisions about their super.\\nGESB is well regarded by its members, employers and peers. The GESB Super, West State Super and Retirement Income Pension products have been awarded with a platinum rating from SuperRatings for 14 consecutive years1 – which means GESB is recognised as being a 'top value-for-money' fund1. GESB consistently delivers strong long-term investment returns that meet or exceed GESB’s objectives, and GESB’s fees are below the industry median.\\nGESB’s purpose is ‘to look after our members’ superannuation with excellence’ and our corporate goal is ‘improved long term superannuation benefits of our members’.\\nIn order to achieve GESB’s purpose and goal, GESB has identified four key strategic objectives, two of which are the main drivers for increasing digital engagement through its digital strategy: \\nMember experience - a positive experience for members when they engage with GESB and in their superannuation, resulting in increased member engagement with their superannuation; and\\nEfficient and effective operations - value for money products and services. The digital channel is a cost effective way to engage and service members and deliver on our member communication goals.\\nGESB’s vision is to have digital as the first, and often only channel used by members to support their information needs, allowing them to easily transact and improve their long-term superannuation benefits. The long-term objective is to use electronic means as the default channel for all communication, moving outbound communications to the digital channel and encouraging inbound queries to self-serve, resulting in member needs being met using cost-effective channels and processes.\\n\\n\\nMember Online\\nGESB’s Member Online portal is key to achieving our objective of delivering a positive member experience through digital channels. The aim is for Member Online to be the central access point used by members for information, transacting and communication. \\nThis is achieved by enhancing the solution’s capabilities, including implementation of an online document centre, form development capability and delivery of more personalised information amongst other functionality. \\nIn order to continue to meet member expectations and deliver on GESB’s digital vision, the system needs to provide these valuable member services as well as be secure, flexible and cost effective. \\nThe current Member Online portal has been identified as reaching its end of life with respect to enabling the digital strategy in a cost effective and timely manner. GESB are in the process of rebuilding the portal. Under the existing contractual arrangements, GESB currently has two incumbent providers. One delivering the member facing front-end website, and the other only providing the back-end Application Programming Interface (API) services for displaying member account information (instead of providing the full end-to-end member portal). \\nGESB recognises that a key to the success of the project is the delivery of a user-friendly, and secure Customer Identity and Access management (CIAM) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Solution that can easily integrate with the front-end Member \",\n",

The WLA-SCS is intended to assist the lottery sector in obtaining a level of security controls in line with generally accepted practices and makes possible an increased reliance on the integrity of lottery operations. It specifies the requirements for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and improving a documented security and integrity system within the context of a lottery organisation’s overall risks. It specifies the requirements for the implementation of security and integrity controls, so that the security and integrity management systems can be designed to ensure the selection of adequate and proportionate security and integrity controls that protect assets and give confidence to interested parties.\\n\\nThe WLA-SCS is aligned with ISO 27001 to allow for consistent and integrated implementation and operation with related management standards.

Further communication was provided to the sector through the State Party’s website.\\n\\nAs a result of findings from the 2019 review process and given the market has not been tested for over a decade, a competitive open tender process was selected to test the market for contemporary service delivery approaches to providing Group Support Activity Services for people with co-occurring mental health and Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) issues and their families and carers including those from CALD backgrounds and Aboriginal people.\\nIn late 2020 the MHC commenced further consultation with the community services sector and invited consumers to provide feedback on the draft RFT for the new Group Support Activity services. This consultation included issuing the draft RFT documents on Tenders WA for public comment. The feedback received from the RFT public consultation process supported the approach to go to open Tender and identified a number of considerations for the service provision, including:\\nThere is a wide range of vulnerable cohorts who would benefit from Group Support Activity Services.\\nFor regional and remote services, specific consideration should be given to local services.\\nThere must be appropriate remuneration for group support facilitators/workers; \\nRecognising groups of themselves (specific cohorts) do not necessarily provide positive and constructive environments.\\nThe importance of group members feeling fully accepted.
