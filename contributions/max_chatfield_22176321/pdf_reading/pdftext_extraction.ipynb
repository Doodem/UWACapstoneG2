      "The school will be completed by April 2025.\n",
      "2. BACKGROUND\n",
      "The School is a standard pattern school which will cater for 540 students (Kindergarten – Year 6)\n",
      "within the permanent buildings & 870 students when the Transportables are utilised. The project\n",
      "includes an Administration Block, a Kindergarten/Pre-Primary Teaching Block 1 (TB1), 2 x\n",
      "Double story Teaching Blocks (TB2 & TB3), a Library Resource Centre and Staff Room and a\n",

      "courts, play areas and bicycle parking.\n",
      "The master plan embodies the following design principles:-\n",
      "• Strong connections between all learning areas, with the library at the heart of the school.\n",
      "• Unrestricted lines of sight for supervision over the students during recess and lunchtime\n",
      "play designed to limit opportunity for antisocial behaviour\n",
      "• The provision of a forecourt to the covered assembly block to allow for spill over for\n",
      "assemblies and other functions. It is envisioned that this area will have a good balance of\n",
      "paving, informal seating and lawn and enable good visual supervision\n",
      "• Indicative landscaped areas for outdoor play\n",
      "• Emergency vehicle access through the centre of the site\n",
      "• Walkways and ramps allowing all areas of the site to be accessible\n",
      "• Provision made for location of required transportable classrooms (up to 12) for Stage\n",

THESE DRAWING SHALL BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH ATC WILLIAMS\\nGEOTECHNICAL REPORT No 120056.01LR01.\\nTHE FOLLOWING IS AN EXCERPT OF THE REPORT.\\nTHE SUBSURFACE CONDITIONS AT THE SITE COMPRISED:\\nTOPSOIL: A THIN LAYER OF LOOSE, FINE AND MEDIUM, BLACK SAND WITH\\nTRACE SILT AND GRASS ROOTS WAS ENCOUNTERED IN ALL TEST PITS\\nACROSS THE SITE TO DEPTHS OF 0.1m.\\nUNCONTROLLED FILL: A LAYER OF DENSE TO VERY DENSE FILL MATERIAL\\nWAS ENCOUNTERED BENEATH THE TOPSOIL IN ALL TEST PITS ACROSS THE\\nSITE. THE FILL MATERIAL COMPRISED BROWN/PALE GREY SAND AND SANDY\\nGRAVEL WITH BUILDING RUBBLE (E.G. BROKEN AND FULL BRICKS AND TILES\\nPRESENT IN ALL TEST PITS TO THEIR FULL EXPLORATION DEPTHS OF\\nBETWEEN 0.7m (TP5) AND 1.4m (TP2).\\nEVIDENCE OF PAST CONCRETE FOOTINGS WAS NOTED ON THE SIDES OF TP2\\nAT A DEPTH OF 0.6m.\\nROCK/LATERITE: THE PRESENCE OF ORANGE BROWN ROCK/LATERITE WAS\\nVISUALLY CONFIRMED AT THE BASE OF ALL TEST PITS EXCEPT TP2.\\nGROUNDWATER: GROUNDWATER WAS NOT ENCOUNTERED DURING THE\\nINVESTIGATION.\\nE3. CONTRACTOR TO MAINTAIN STRICT DUST CONTROL MEASURES AT ALL\\nTIMES. CONTRACTOR TO SUBMIT DUST MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR A SITE\\nCLASSIFICATION 4 IN ACCORDANCE WITH DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENT \"A\\nGUIDELINE FOR THE PREVENTION OF DUST AND SMOKE POLLUTION FROM LAND\\nDEVELOPMENT SITES IN WESTERN AUSTRALIA\". ALL CONTROL MEASURES\\nINCLUDING WIND FENCING ARE TO BE INCLUDED IN TENDER.\\nE4. DESIGNATED EXISTING SITE TREES & VEGETATION AS SPECIFIED ON THE\\nARCHITECTURAL DRAWINGS TO BE REMOVED FROM SITE TO AN APPROVED\\nDISPOSAL SITE IN ACCORDANCE WITH EPA & LOCAL COUNCIL REQUIREMENTS\\nPRIOR TO EARTHWORKS COMMENCING. NO BURNING TO BE CARRIED OUT. ANY\\nTOPSOIL (TYPICALLY 100mm), ORGANIC AND DELETERIOUS MATERIAL INCLUDING\\nTREE ROOTS SHALL BE REMOVED PRIOR TO PROOF ROLLING AND/OR\\nPLACEMENT OF ADDITIONAL FILL.\\nALL EXISTING STREET TREES TO BE MAINTAINED & PROTECTED AT ALL TIMES\\nUNLESS NOTED OTHERWISE.\\nE5. SITE PREPARATION AND COMPACTION TO BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE\\nSPECIFICATION & GEOTECHNICAL REPORT. CONTRACTOR TO ALLOW FOR PROOF\\nROLLING OF SUBGRADE TO ACHIEVE 95% SMDD.\\nE6. CONTRACTOR IS TO ALLOW FOR IMPORTING & EXPORTING OF ADDITIONAL\\nSAND FILL FOR FINAL HARD & SOFT LANDSCAPING DURING FINAL TRIMMING OF\\nTHE SITE. REFER ARCHITECTS DRAWINGS FOR LOCATIONS & LEVELS.\\nE7. CONTRACTOR TO ALLOW FOR THE REMOVAL OF ALL RUBBISH AND\\nUNCONTROLLED FILL FROM SITE TO AN APPROVED DISPOSAL SITE.\\nE8. MAXIMUM BATTER SLOPE FOR TEMPORARY EXCAVATIONS 1 IN 2. MAXIMUM\\nBATTER SLOPES AT FINISHED SURFACE LEVELS 1 IN 6 WITHOUT GROUND\\nSTABILISATION.\\nE9. UNLESS OTHERWISE APPROVED BY THE ENGINEER, NO EXCAVATION SHALL\\nBE CARRIED OUT CLOSER TO FOOTINGS, SERVICES OR OTHER BELOW GROUND\\nSTRUCTURES THAN A LINE EXTENDING DOWN FROM THEIR EDGE AT 45°.\\nE10. ANY EXCAVATED CLEAN SANDS TO BE STOCKPILED FOR RE-USE AS\\nSTRUCTURAL FILL. CONTRACTOR TO ENSURE IT IS FREE OF TOPSOIL, ORGANIC\\n& DELETERIOUS MATTER.\\nE11. PARTICULAR CARE TO BE TAKEN TO ENSURE COMPACTION IS ACHIEVED\\nAT THE LOCATIONS WHERE TREES OR REDUNDANT BELOW GROUND\\nSTRUCTURES ARE REMOVED.\\nE12. ALTHOUGH NOT ENCOUNTERED DURING THE INVESTIGATION IT IS POSSIBLE\\nTHAT ROADWORKS COULD OCCUR IN THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE SITE\\nCLOSER TO DIPROSE CRESCENT ON CLAYEY SOILS. IF ENCOUNTERED, THESE\\nSOILS ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE CONDUCIVE TO INFILTRATION AND WILL DRAIN\\nPOORLY DURING THE WETTER TIMES OF THE YEAR. THIS COULD RESULT IN\\nSATURATED CONDITIONS THAT MAY INHIBIT PREPARATION AND COMPACTION\\nOF THE SUBGRADE. THE CONTRACTOR SHALL ALLOW FOR PRACTICES\\nSUITABLE FOR WORKS IN THE WINTER PERIOD AS NECESSARY TO ENSURE\\nACCEPTABLE WORKMANSHIP.\\nCOMPACTION AND TRAFFICKING OF CLAYEY AREAS MUST NOT BE ATTEMPTED\\nWHEN WET. IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ALLOW THE AREA TO DRY OUT OR\\nTRIM OFF WET MATERIAL BACK TO COMPETENT, DRIER SUBGRADE. ANY\\nATTEMPT TO TRAFFIC OR COMPACT WET CLAYEY SOILS IS LIKELY TO RESULT\\nIN SOIL DISTURBANCE AND SIGNIFICANT SOFTENING OF THE CLAYEY SOILS.\\nE14. ANY EXCAVATIONS INTO THE EXISTING GROUND FOR REMOVAL OF\\nREDUNDANT STRUCTURES, FOOTINGS, SERVICES AND THE LIKE TO BE\\nBACKFILLED WITH IN-SITU MATERIALS. CONTRACTOR TO ENSURE INSITU\\nCLAYS, GRAVELS & SILTY MATERIALS ARE APPROPRIATELY MOISTURE\\nCONDITIONED AND PREPARED TO ENSURE ADEQUATE COMPACTION AND\\nWORKMANSHIP.\\nE15. PROOF COMPACT ANY EXPOSED SURFACES TO IDENTIFY AND IMPROVE\\nANY WEAK AREAS. ANY SOFT OR WEAK AREAS NOT RESPONDING TO\\nCOMPACTION SHOULD BE REMOVED AND REPLACED WITH A SIMILAR CLAYEY\\nMATERIAL TO MATCH INSITU, OR LEAN MIX CONCRETE. IN ROAD PAVEMENT\\nAREAS, BACKFILL WITH LIMESTONE ROAD BASE IS ACCEPTABLE.\\nWHERE OVER-EXCAVATIONS OCCUR TO REMOVAL UNSUITABLE MATERIAL, THE\\nCONTRACTOR SHALL ALLOW 48 HOURS NOTICE FOR THE SUPERINTENDENT TO\\nADVISE IF A GROUND SURVEY IS REQUIRED TO QUANTIFY THE OVER\\nEXCAVATED MATERIAL.\\nSHOULD MATERIALS BECOME WET AND SOFTEN, THESE WILL ALSO REQUIRE\\nREMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT.\\nUNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE IS SAND FILL AN ACCEPTABLE REPLACEMENT\\nBACKFILL MATERIAL.\\nE16. MAINTAIN ALL NATURAL SOIL IN A DRY CONDITION. SHAPE AND BATTER\\nGROUND TO FALL AWAY FROM BUILDINGS. WHERE CLAY OR CLAYEY SOILS\\nARE EXPOSED DURING THE WORKS, THE CONTRACTOR SHALL TAKE ALL\\nNECESSARY MEASURES TO PROTECT THE SITE AND PREVENT SOFTENING OF\\nTHE SOILS DUE TO WATER OR MOISTURE  INGRESS AND PONDING INCLUDING,\\nBUT NOT LIMITED TO THE PROVISION OF\\n·BLUE METAL DRAINS\\n·TEMPORARY SUMPS AND CUT-OFF DRAINS\\n·AND GRADING OF THE SURFACE AWAY TO ALLOW FLOW AWAY FROM\\nTHE AREA OF THE WORKS.\\n·SAND BAGGING\\nTHE BUILDER SHALL ALLOW TO BACKFILL AND MAKE GOOD ALL TEMPORARY\\nDRAINS REQUIRED FOR PREPARATION OF SUBGRADE.022.01.21 ISSUED FOR TENDER TB\\nDRAWING No.\\nDoF PROJ No.DESIGNED\\nDATE SCALE @ A1APPROVEDDRAWN\\nCHECKED\\nREV.\\nTHIS IS A CAD DRAWING - DO NOT AMEND MANUALLYTENDER FILE No.NO DATE AMENDMENT CHECKED\\nTENDER\\nAlbany Health Campus - Radiation\\nOncology Service\\n30 Warden Avenue SPENCER PARK, WA, 6330BPA Engineering\\n460 Roberts Road, Subiaco, WA 6008\\nTel: (08) 9382 8008 tbroadwood@bpaeng.com.auStructural / Civil\\nSG&K\\n9 Alvan Street, Mount Lawley, WA 6050\\nTel: (08) 9389 8393 paulm@sgk.com.auMechanical / Medical Gases\\nETC\\n61 Loftus Street, Leederville, WA 6007\\nTel: (08) 9328 5500 rmilburn@etcpl.com.auElectrical\\nJacobs\\nLevel 11, 263 Adelaide Terrace, WA 6000\\nTel: (08) 9469 5480 david.belcastro@jacobs.comHydraulics / Fire\\nFour Landscape Studio\\n11/34 Eighth Avenue, Maylands, WA, 6051\\nTel: (08) 9286 4900 andrew@fourls.com.auLandscaping\\nMilestone Certifiers\\n3/1 The Esplanade, Mount Pleasant, Perth, WA 6153\\nTel: (08) 9330 7476 richarda@milestonebc.com.auBCA Compliancepscott@bpaeng.com.aupeter hunt architectArchitect\\n8 Colin Grove, West Perth, WA 6005\\nTel: (08) 9322 6033 pha@peterhunt.com.au\\n14606 2020/042782\\nN\\nNMAIN WORKS\\nBPA PROJ No.\\nS14319'"
