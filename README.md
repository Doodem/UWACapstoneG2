# UWA Capstone G2

## Introduction

The UWA Capstone Project will determine if machine learning can be applied to existing Tenders WA (Western Australian Government Tendering system) data to provide efficiencies in WA Government tendering processes and provide the tendering agencies with increased insights from our Tenders data.  

Tenders WA makes the tendering process for Western Australian Government contracts transparent and efficient; and is the central source of information on Western Australian public sector requests and awarded contracts, including sole source purchases.

## Project Details Section

### Objectives

* Identify procurement contracts across agencies that may be suitable for a single procurement process by identifying the best describable contract type in contract submissions.  

* Harness the advances in natural language processing to analyse United Nations Standard Products and Services Code descriptions and contract descriptions  

### Background

The Department of Financeâ€™s Inform and Improve team has developed the Tenders WA Dashboard which is used by internal and external agency stakeholders. This dashboard contains various information on procurement contracts, for example: awarded contracts, supplier contracts, contract variations, expiring contracts and contracts without an expiry date.  

Using different data exploration techniques, we would like to explore:  

* Listing of contracts across agencies that could be open to a single procurement process.  

  * Various agencies have multiple contracts published and they involve one or multiple suppliers. Identify if these contracts across multiple agencies may be combined into a common procurement process that meets their requirements.  
  
  * Identifying future single-contract opportunities across government agencies. Currently, government entities have numerous similar contracts (outside of the Common User Arrangements framework) that involve many differing processes. Identifying these opportunities for reducing the time and effort in the engagement process and contract management by all stakeholders.
